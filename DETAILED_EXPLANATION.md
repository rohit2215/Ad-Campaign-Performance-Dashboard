## 🏗️ Project Architecture (Step-by-Step Breakdown)

### Phase 1: Data Generation (`src/data_generation.py`)

#### What is Data Generation?
In real companies, you get data from advertising platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, or Microsoft Advertising. Since we're learning, we create **synthetic data** that mimics real advertising data.

#### Why Synthetic Data?
- **Safe to experiment**: No real company data
- **Controlled environment**: We know what the data should look like
- **Realistic patterns**: Mimics real advertising behavior
- **Reproducible**: Same results every time

#### Deep Dive into the Code:

```python
def generate_campaign_data(start_date='2024-01-01', days=90):
```

**What this function does:**
1. **Creates a date range**: 90 days of data from January 1, 2024
2. **Defines campaigns**: 5 different advertising campaigns with different budgets and types
3. **Generates realistic metrics**: Impressions, clicks, conversions, cost, revenue

**Key Concepts Explained:**

**Campaign Types:**
- **Search Campaigns**: Text ads that appear when people search for keywords
- **Display Campaigns**: Banner ads that appear on websites

**Advertising Metrics:**
- **Impressions**: How many times your ad was shown
- **Clicks**: How many times someone clicked your ad
- **Conversions**: How many people took the desired action (like buying)
- **Cost**: How much money you spent
- **Revenue**: How much money you earned

**Realistic Relationships:**
```python
# CTR varies by campaign type and device
base_ctr = 0.02 if campaign['type'] == 'Search' else 0.005
```
- Search ads typically have higher click-through rates than display ads
- Mobile devices get more traffic than desktop
- Weekend traffic is lower than weekday traffic

#### Anomaly Injection:
```python
def add_anomalies(df, anomaly_rate=0.05):
```

**Why add anomalies?**
Real data is messy! We add problems like:
- **Missing values**: Some data points are empty
- **Outliers**: Extreme values that don't make sense
- **Data errors**: Negative clicks (impossible in real life)

This teaches you how to handle real-world data issues.

---

### Phase 2: Data Processing (`src/data_processing.py`)

#### What is Data Processing?
Raw data is like a messy room - it needs cleaning and organizing before you can use it. This step transforms raw data into clean, analysis-ready data.

#### Step-by-Step Processing:

**1. Data Quality Assessment:**
```python
def assess_data_quality(df):
```

**What we check:**
- **Missing values**: Are there empty cells?
- **Data types**: Are dates actually dates, numbers actually numbers?
- **Duplicates**: Are there repeated records?
- **Logical consistency**: Do the numbers make sense?

**2. Data Cleaning:**
```python
def clean_data(df):
```

**Handling Missing Values:**
```python
# Fill missing clicks with 0 (if no clicks, it's 0)
df_clean['clicks'] = df_clean['clicks'].fillna(0)

# Fill missing cost with median (average cost)
median_cost = df_clean['cost'].median()
df_clean['cost'] = df_clean['cost'].fillna(median_cost)
```

**Why different strategies?**
- **Clicks**: Can't have negative clicks, so 0 makes sense
- **Cost**: Using median preserves the typical cost pattern

**Handling Outliers:**
```python
# IQR Method for outlier detection
Q1 = df_clean[col].quantile(0.25)  # 25th percentile
Q3 = df_clean[col].quantile(0.75)  # 75th percentile
IQR = Q3 - Q1
lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
```

**What is IQR?**
- **Interquartile Range**: The middle 50% of your data
- **Outlier**: Any value outside 1.5 times the IQR
- **Why cap instead of remove?** Preserves data volume while fixing extreme values

**3. Feature Engineering:**
```python
def add_features(df):
```

**Time-based Features:**
```python
df_features['day_of_week'] = df_features['date'].dt.day_name()
df_features['is_weekend'] = df_features['date'].dt.weekday >= 5
```

**Why add these?**
- **Day of week**: Helps identify patterns (Mondays vs Fridays)
- **Weekend flag**: Weekends often have different performance

**Performance Categories:**
```python
df_features['ctr_category'] = pd.cut(
    df_features['ctr'], 
    bins=[0, 1, 2, 5, 100], 
    labels=['Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Very High']
)
```

**What this does:**
- Groups CTR values into meaningful categories
- Makes analysis easier (compare "High" vs "Low" instead of numbers)

---

### Phase 3: Analysis (`src/analysis.py`)

#### What is Analysis?
Analysis is where we turn clean data into insights. We calculate KPIs, find patterns, and generate recommendations.

#### KPI Calculation:
```python
def calculate_overall_kpis(df):
```

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

**1. Click-Through Rate (CTR):**
```python
ctr = (total_clicks / total_impressions) * 100
```
- **What it means**: Percentage of people who clicked your ad
- **Why important**: Measures ad relevance and appeal
- **Good CTR**: 1-3% for search ads, 0.1-1% for display ads

**2. Cost Per Click (CPC):**
```python
cpc = total_cost / total_clicks
```
- **What it means**: Average cost for each click
- **Why important**: Measures advertising efficiency
- **Industry average**: $1-3 for most industries

**3. Cost Per Acquisition (CPA):**
```python
cpa = total_cost / total_conversions
```
- **What it means**: Cost to get one customer
- **Why important**: Measures customer acquisition efficiency
- **Business impact**: Directly affects profitability

**4. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS):**
```python
roas = total_revenue / total_cost
```
- **What it means**: How much revenue you get for each dollar spent
- **Why important**: Primary measure of advertising success
- **Good ROAS**: >4x is excellent, >2x is good, <1x means losing money

**5. Conversion Rate:**
```python
conversion_rate = (total_conversions / total_clicks) * 100
```
- **What it means**: Percentage of clicks that became customers
- **Why important**: Measures website/landing page effectiveness
- **Industry average**: 1-5% for most industries

#### Segmentation Analysis:

**Campaign Performance:**
```python
campaign_performance = df.groupby(['campaign_id', 'campaign_name']).agg({
    'impressions': 'sum',
    'clicks': 'sum',
    'conversions': 'sum',
    'cost': 'sum',
    'revenue': 'sum'
}).reset_index()
```

**What groupby does:**
- Groups data by campaign
- Aggregates (sums) all metrics for each campaign
- Creates a summary table

**Device Analysis:**
```python
device_performance = df.groupby('device').agg({
    'revenue': 'sum',
    'cost': 'sum'
}).reset_index()
```

**Why analyze by device?**
- **Mobile**: Usually higher volume, lower conversion rates
- **Desktop**: Usually lower volume, higher conversion rates
- **Tablet**: Often in between

**Location Analysis:**
```python
location_performance = df.groupby('location').agg({
    'roas': 'mean',
    'revenue': 'sum'
}).reset_index()
```

**Why analyze by location?**
- **Geographic targeting**: Some areas perform better than others
- **Budget allocation**: Invest more in high-performing areas
- **Market expansion**: Identify new opportunities

#### Time Series Analysis:
```python
daily_performance = df.groupby('date').agg({
    'revenue': 'sum',
    'cost': 'sum'
}).reset_index()
```

**Moving Averages:**
```python
daily_performance['revenue_ma7'] = daily_performance['revenue'].rolling(window=7).mean()
```

**What is a moving average?**
- **Smooths out daily fluctuations**
- **Shows underlying trends**
- **7-day window**: Average of current day + 6 previous days

#### Anomaly Detection:
```python
def detect_anomalies(df, threshold=2.0):
```

**Z-Score Method:**
```python
z_scores = np.abs((daily_metrics[metric] - mean_val) / std_val)
anomaly_dates = daily_metrics[z_scores > threshold]['date']
```

**What is Z-Score?**
- **Measures how many standard deviations a value is from the mean**
- **Threshold of 2.0**: Values more than 2 standard deviations away are anomalies
- **Why important**: Identifies unusual performance that needs investigation

#### Insights Generation:
```python
def generate_insights(df, campaign_performance, device_performance, location_performance):
```

**Top Performers:**
```python
best_campaign = campaign_performance.loc[campaign_performance['roas'].idxmax()]
```

**Optimization Opportunities:**
```python
worst_campaign = campaign_performance.loc[campaign_performance['roas'].idxmin()]
if worst_campaign['roas'] < 1.0:
    insights['optimization_opportunities'].append(f"Consider pausing {worst_campaign['campaign_name']}")
```

**Business Logic:**
- **ROAS < 1.0**: Losing money (spending more than earning)
- **ROAS > 4.0**: Excellent performance
- **High CPC**: May need bid optimization

### Phase 4: Dashboard (`src/dashboard.py`)

#### What is a Dashboard?
A dashboard is a visual interface that displays key information at a glance. Think of it like a car's dashboard - you can see speed, fuel, temperature all in one place.

#### Streamlit Framework:
```python
import streamlit as st
```

**Why Streamlit?**
- **Python-based**: Easy to learn if you know Python
- **Interactive**: Users can filter and explore data

```python
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Ad Campaign Performance Dashboard",
    page_icon="📊",
    layout="wide",
    initial_sidebar_state="expanded"
)
```

**2. Custom Styling:**
```python
st.markdown("""
<style>
    .metric-card {
        background-color: #f0f2f6;
        padding: 1rem;
        border-radius: 0.5rem;
        border-left: 4px solid #1f77b4;
    }
</style>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

**3. Data Loading:**
```python
@st.cache_data
def load_data():
    data = {}
    data['main'] = pd.read_csv('data/campaign_data_processed.csv')
    return data
```

**What is @st.cache_data?**
- **Caches the data**: Loads once, reuses for faster performance
- **Important for large datasets**: Prevents reloading every time user interacts

**4. KPI Cards:**
```python
def create_kpi_cards(kpis):
    col1, col2, col3, col4, col5 = st.columns(5)
    
    with col1:
        st.markdown(f"""
        <div class="metric-card">
            <div class="kpi-value">{kpis['ctr']:.2f}%</div>
            <div class="kpi-label">Click-Through Rate</div>
        </div>
        """, unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

**What this does:**
- **Creates 5 columns**: Evenly spaced across the page
- **Displays KPIs**: Each in its own styled card
- **HTML/CSS**: Custom styling for professional appearance

**5. Interactive Charts:**
```python
def create_revenue_cost_chart(df):
    fig = go.Figure()
    
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=daily_data['date'],
        y=daily_data['revenue'],
        mode='lines+markers',
        name='Revenue',
        line=dict(color='#2ca02c', width=3)
    ))
```

**Plotly Charts:**
- **Interactive**: Users can hover, zoom, pan
- **Professional**: Publication-quality graphics
- **Customizable**: Colors, styles, layouts

**6. Navigation:**
```python
page = st.sidebar.selectbox(
    "Choose a Section",
    ["📈 Overview", "🎯 Campaign Analysis", "📱 Device Analysis", "📍 Location Analysis"]
)
```

**Sidebar Navigation:**
- **Organizes content**: Different views for different purposes
- **User-friendly**: Easy to switch between analyses
- **Scalable**: Can add more sections easily

**7. Filtering:**
```python
selected_campaigns = st.multiselect(
    "Select Campaigns",
    options=df['campaign_name'].unique(),
    default=df['campaign_name'].unique()[:3]
)
```

**Interactive Filters:**
- **Multiselect**: Choose multiple campaigns
- **Date picker**: Select date ranges
- **Real-time updates**: Charts update as you filter
